Serial interval and generation interval for respectively the imported and local infectors estimated using reported contact-tracing 
data of COVID-19 in China

Supporting materials for M. Li et al 2020 "Serial interval and generation interval for respectively the imported and local infectors 
estimated using reported contact-tracing data of COVID-19 in China"

Our repository consists of the following parts:

1.Code for estimating the parameters of interval based on sample data,which refers to the code on the following page, 
https://github.com/aakhmetz/nCoVSerialInterval2020

2. Sample data for our analysis, which extracted from online reports released by 10 provincial health commissions in China except Hubei,
including the serial interval of 337  infector-infectee pairs, the generation interval of 43 infector-infectee pairsï¼Œ the incubation 
period of 545 cases and the intervals upon arrival for imported cases. E_L (S_L) and E_R (S_R) are start date and end date for 
corresponding intervals, where E_L="date"-"2019-12-01". The dist is set as (S_L+S_R)/2-(E_L+E_R)/2.

3. Results Data used for our figures.
